Review: Neon Genesis Anima volume 2 picks of where we last left off Shinji is fighting Hikari in a new Eva Euro II. Asuka is performing David Bowe‚Äôs a Space Oddity cover on the moon, which is now two sizes bigger. We have the beginning of our globetrotting mecha light novel, which is 100 pages longer than volume 1 we have Neon Genesis Anima volume 2. As Nerv tries to prevent the second attempt of the Human Instrumentally Project from ArmarosJust like the last volume, the series is all about the mechas and the battles. Take the Eva battles from the original anime and even the rebuilds times it by 100, and we have the Anima series in a nutshell. Pure, unfiltered unapologetic mecha worldwide. The plot goes outside of Japan to places like Cyprus, Morocco, Russia, and The Moon as the fate of humanity is once again in Shinji‚Äôs hands. Although it does get ridiculous at times, the fact that the earth is currently being shrunk two smaller causing natural disasters 24/7 and on top of that we have skirmishes breaking out between Europe and NERV. I get that they‚Äôre trying to raise the stakes to make it bigger and worse then it‚Äôs ever been. It just comes off as eye-rolling to be entirely honest that the earth would experience this much damage, and there‚Äôs still civilization, and it hasn‚Äôt all turned to Mad Max. Despite that, the fights are one of the highlights. The best arguments are Asuka and Angel on the moon and Shinki fighting two mechs in the Quantum Realm.The best part of the light novel, hands down, has to be the characters. They step up a show their growth in the three years time skip. Such as, Toji who you see become Nerv commander HQ and how he steps up during his leadership role. Rei and the french clones Rei Trois, Rei Quatre, and Rei Six. How they highlight aspects of her personality with Rei Trois, who hates being compared to Yui Ikari even though she‚Äôs a clone of her. It‚Äôs great! Even Shinji, who is now one with his Eva learning to control his new power and is learning to fly with Super Eva. Pretty much, all the characters shine even though a lot of the peaceful segments have been cut from the first volume as the Eva and Angel fights are ramping up.In conclusion, Neon Genesis Anima 2 continues the Mecha Kino from the last volume and turns it up to eleven as we go to work 3. Any mecha fans, this novel is a wet dream as it goes into the details of all the mechas, the upgrades, and the technology. Evangelion fans see the characters basically be the Avengers of the Earth and being guardians of the planet, as Armaros is pretty much Thanos and is all about bring balance to the world after the third impact was prevented in this timeline. Through the twists and turns, Anima delivers in a great spin-off/sequel to Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Review: I was a little lukewarm on the first Anima book but this one really finds its stride and kept me hooked from start to finish, it also felt much longer and more detailed in its descriptions. The character dialogue here sounds much more like the characters from the show too, so this is an easy recommendation for NGE fans.I read this back to back with book 3 so I may be mixing up things from the third book, but interestingly there are a few ideas and characters in this book that come from the Rebuild movies, which is a nice way of using the great ideas from those films.

Review: Neon Genesis Evangelion: ANIMA Vol. 2 by Ikuto Yamashita is a Young Adult tie-in novel based on the anime franchise ‚ÄúNeon Genesis Evangelion‚Äù.Neon Genesis Evangelion: ANIMA is set in an alternate timeline set apart from anime and it‚Äôs various movies. Evangelion ANIMA gives us a rather charming alternate ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion - what if ? Shinji had managed to save Tokyo-3 and the world from the Third Impact.The novel is set 3 years after the end of the Human Instrumentality Project, replacing episodes 25 and 26 of the anime, as well as the End of Evangelion film. Where in the Human Instrumentality Project failed without taking the world with it. In this alternative future, Shinji Ikari had somewhat saved the world from oblivion. Given his exploits, he became the de facto leader of the EVA team. Since three years has passed in this timeline, the Evangelion suits are also given some nifty upgrades to combat the upcoming evils, in this case, the return of the monstrous alien creatures known as Angels.Neon Genesis Anima Volume. 2, picks of where the last book left off. A mysterious black EVA unit called Armaros armed with the Spear of Longinus has attacked the moon causing a swarm of natural disasters across Earth. Causing high tensions between various world governments. Who lay the blame on Japan‚Äôs NERV Organization. As the various EVA pilots and members of NERV race to avert disaster many factors play against them. Shinji is left fighting Hikari in a new Eva Euro II as the UN military forces try‚Äôs to invade Japan. Asuka piloting her EVA unit is left stranded in space as she fights for survival against massed produced EVA units controlled by Angles. We have the beginning of a globetrotting mecha light novel, As Nerv and the EVA pilots race to prevent the second attempt of the Human Instrumentally Project from Armaros.Just like the last volume, the series is all about the mechas and the battles. Take the Eva battles from the original anime and even the rebuilds times it by 100, and we have the Anima series in a nutshell. Pure, unfiltered unapologetic mecha worldwide.
